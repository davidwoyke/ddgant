A weathered structure of brick and plank supports a decrepit lighthouse there. Local legend speculates the place was once home to an eccentric scholar and practicer of magics. For the better part of a century, the lighthouse has stood dormant, and the forces of nature have all but reclaimed the utilitarian facade. Of late, crabbers and leech collectors report a dim, flickering light on the horizon during the early morning hours of their commute. Under the high sun, the anxious waves crash down upon an idle dock, which guards the only path up to the crowning edifice. Days pass, the light burns, and rumor spreads. The coast is alive with story, and the flames at Temperance burn once more.\nThe wizard of the islet, Prowst, has entered into a deep, magical slumber, intending to wait out the results of a century-long experiment. He has left behind his trusted familiar, Eku the toad, to care for the facility and guard against malicious intruders. One of Prowst\u0026rsquo;s academic rivals has sent their own familiar, Nima the rat, to meddle with the experiment. The forces of Nima have acted to prevent the wizard\u0026rsquo;s rousing, and his uneasy dreams now seep into reality. In distress, Eku lit the beacon atop the lighthouse, chancing to attract a savior to rescue Prowst and sway the fate of the islet of Temperance— before it\u0026rsquo;s too late.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/the-flames-witnessed-at-temperance/docs/","title":"Docs","section":"The Flames Witnessed at Temperance","content":""}]
